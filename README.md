Smart Pump : Controlling flow rate has always been a critical process for most microfluidic applications and research
experiments. In this project, we conceptualized and developed a pressure driven pump to deliver flow and provide
the best control of the fluids at a microfluidic scale.

# Getting Started

With the achieved high-precision control of the liquid flow and the subseconds response time, our
pump system can largely compete with industrial alternatives at a fraction of the cost. As shown in the
droplet experiments (see documentation), our device system can be a viable alternative to costly industrial pressure driven
pumps for most of the research application

Prerequisites
This project requires the following software:

Python stable release 3.8.0 (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/)
TensorFlow stable release 2.3.0 (https://www.tensorflow.org/install)
Configuration
If the project is directly cloned from Gitlab, the database paths are already contained in the ./data directory and implemented in the code. In case of any changes, you can find the requested database in the according sub-directory ./data/...

All the required packages and modules that donâ€™t come as part of the python standard library are to be found in the requirements.txt file.
