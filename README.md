## Smart Pressure Driven Microfluidic Pump

Precise control of flow rate has always been a critical process for most microfluidic applications and research experiments in various fields such as biochemistry, nanotechnology, and biotechnology. In this project, we conceptualized and developed a smart pressure driven pump capable of transporting microfluids at a stable minimum flow rate as low as 0, 1µl/min while providing a user friendly usage experience. With the achieved high-precision control of the liquid flow and the submillisecond response time, our DIY smart pump largely competes with its industrial alternatives at a fraction of the cost (250€ vs 1850€).

Smart Pump : Controlling flow rate has always been a critical process for most microfluidic applications and research
experiments. In this project, we conceptualized and developed a pressure driven pump to deliver flow and provide
the best control of the fluids at a microfluidic scale.

# Getting Started

With the achieved high-precision control of the liquid flow and the subseconds response time, our
pump system can largely compete with industrial alternatives at a fraction of the cost. As shown in the
droplet experiments (see documentation), our device system can be a viable alternative to costly industrial pressure driven
pumps for most of the research application

These instructions will guide through the project for development and testing purposes.
