Smart Pump : Controlling flow rate has always been a critical process for most microfluidic applications and research
experiments. In this project, we conceptualized and developed a pressure driven pump to deliver flow and provide
the best control of the fluids at a microfluidic scale.

 * For a full description of the project, please read the project documentation included
 in the repository:

# Getting Started

With the achieved high-precision control of the liquid flow and the subseconds response time, our
pump system can largely compete with industrial alternatives at a fraction of the cost. As shown in the
droplet experiments (see documentation), our device system can be a viable alternative to costly industrial pressure driven
pumps for most of the research application

These instructions will guide through the project for development and testing purposes.

* The folder naming in this project follows the pattern:

    ```hardware        --> housing and pcb data```

    ```software        --> simulations, microcontroller and GUI```
    
    ```documentation        --> documentation of the project```
